# understanding_ssps

- The PDF file `Understanding HexSSPs.pdf` contains Jeff's lecture notes on the Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR), and how to understand Spatial Semantic Pointers (SSPs) and their similarity maps.
- The PDF file `HRRs.pdf` are Jeff's notes that expand a bit on the "pseudo-spatial" HRR version of SSPs (as used by default in Nengo).
- The jupyter notebook `understanding SSPs.ipynb` demonstrates the concepts outlined in the FHRR notes.
